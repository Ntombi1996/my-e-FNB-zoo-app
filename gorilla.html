                    <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                    <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 
        1.25 and 1.8 m (4 ft 1 in and 5 ft 11 in), weights between 100 and 270 kg 
        (220 and 600 lb), and arm spans up to 2.6 m (8 ft 6 in), depending on species and sex. 
        They tend to live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback. 
        The eastern gorilla is distinguished from the western by darker fur colour and 
        some other minor morphological differences. Gorillas tend to live 35â€“40 years in the wild.</p>
                    <p>Gorillas are considered highly intelligent. A few individuals in captivity, 
                such as Koko, have been taught a subset of sign language. 
                Like the other great apes, gorillas can laugh, grieve, have "rich emotional lives", 
                develop strong family bonds, make and use tools, and think about the past and future. 
                Some researchers believe gorillas have spiritual feelings or religious sentiments. 
                They have been shown to have cultures in different areas revolving around different methods 
                of food preparation, and will show individual</p>
                    <p>Gorillas have a patchy distribution. The range of the two species is separated 
                by the Congo River and its tributaries. The western gorilla lives in west central Africa, 
                while the eastern gorilla lives in east central Africa. 
                Between the species, and even within the species, gorillas live in a variety of habitats 
                and elevations. Gorilla habitat ranges from montane forest to swampland. 
                Eastern gorillas inhabit montane and submontane forests 
                between 650 and 4,000 m (2,130 and 13,120 ft) above sea level.</p>
                        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                        <p>You will find the gorillas at pen E29, right next to the restaurant.</p>
