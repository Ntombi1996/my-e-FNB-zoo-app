                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>giraffe, (genus Giraffa), any of four species in the genus Giraffa of long-necked 
cud-chewing hoofed mammals of Africa, with long legs and a coat pattern of irregular brown patches on a light background. 
Giraffes are the tallest of all land animals; males (bulls) may exceed 5.5 metres (18 feet) in height, 
and the tallest females (cows) are about 4.5 metres. 
Using prehensile tongues almost half a metre long, they are able to browse foliage almost six metres from the ground.</p>
<p>The front legs tend to be longer than the hind legs, and males have proportionally longer front legs than females, 
     which gives them better support when swinging their necks during fights. 
     The leg bones lack first, second and fifth metapodials, 
     It appears that a suspensory ligament allows the lanky legs to support the animal's great weight. 
    The hooves of large male giraffes reach 31 cm/23 cm 12.2 in 9.1 in diameter. 
    The fetlock of the leg is low to the ground, 
     allowing the hoof to better support the animal's weight. 
    Giraffes lack dewclaws and interdigital glands. 
        While the pelvis is relatively short, the ilium has stretched-out crest</p>
    <p>Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and open woodlands. They prefer areas dominated by Acacieae, 
Commiphora, Combretum and Terminalia trees over Brachystegia which are more densely spaced. 
The Angolan giraffe can be found in desert environments.</p>
                        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                        <p>You will find the giraffes at pen E29, right next to the monkey's cage.</p>
