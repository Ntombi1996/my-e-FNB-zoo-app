                    <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                    <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply panda, 
                is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its white coat with black patches around the eyes, 
                ears, legs and shoulders. Its body is rotund; adult individuals weigh 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb) 
                and are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in) long. It is sexually dimorphic, with males being 
                typically 10 to 20% larger than females. A thumb is visible on its forepaw, which helps in holding 
                bamboo in place for feeding. It has large molar teeth and expanded temporal fossa to meet its dietary 
                requirements. It can digest starch and is mostly herbivorous with a diet consisting almost entirely of bamboo and 
                bamboo shoots.</p>
                    <p>Despite its taxonomic classification as a carnivoran, the giant panda's diet is primarily herbivorous, 
                with approximately 99% of its diet consisting of bamboo. However, the giant panda still has the 
                digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes, and thus derives little energy and 
                little protein from the consumption of bamboo. The ability to break down cellulose and lignin is very weak, 
                and their main source of nutrients comes from starch and hemicelluloses.</p>
                    <p>The giant panda is endemic to China. It is found in small, fragmented populations in six 
                mountainous regions in the country, mainly in Sichuan, and also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu. 
                Successful habitat preservation has seen a rise in panda numbers, though loss of habitat due to 
                human activities remains its biggest threat. In areas with a high concentration of 
                medium-to-large-sized mammals—such as domestic cattle, a species known to degrade the landscape—the 
                giant panda population is generally low. This is mainly attributed to the panda's avoidance of 
                interspecific competition.</p>
