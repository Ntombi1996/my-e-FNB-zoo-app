                    <h3>KAOLA</h3>
                    <p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), sometimes inaccurately called the koala bear, 
                is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of 
                the family Phascolarctidae. Its closest living relatives are the wombats. 
                The koala is found in coastal areas of the island's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, 
                New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, 
                tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, dark nose. The koala has a body length of 
                60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (8.8–33.1 lb). Its fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate 
                brown.</p>
                    <p>The koala is a robust animal with a large head and vestigial or non-existent tail. 
                It has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and a weight of 4-15 kg (8.8-33.1 lb), 
                making it among the largest arboreal marsupials. Koalas from Victoria are twice as heavy as those from Queensland. 
                The species is sexually dimorphic: males are 50% larger than females. Males' noses are more curved and sport chest 
                glands, which are visible as bald patches. The female's pouch opening is secured by a sphincter which holds 
                the young in.</p>
                    <p>The koala's range covers roughly 1,000,000 km2 (390,000 sq mi), and 30 ecoregions. 
            It ranges throughout mainland eastern and southeastern Australia, including the states of Queensland, 
            New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. The koala was introduced to several nearby islands.
            The population on Magnetic Island represents the northern limit of its range. Fossil evidence shows 
            that the koala's range stretched as far west as southwestern Western Australia during the 
            late Pleistocene. They were likely driven to extinction in these areas by environmental 
            changes and hunting by Indigenous Australians. Koalas were introduced to Western Australia at 
            Yanchep in 1938 but that population was reduced to 4 individuals by 2022. Koalas can be found 
            in both tropical and temperate habitats ranging from dense woodlands to more spaced-out forests.
            In semi-arid climates, they prefer riparian habitats, where nearby streams and creeks provide 
            refuge during times of drought and extreme heat</p>

                        <p>You will find the kaola at pen E30, right next to the giraffes</p>
