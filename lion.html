                    <h3>LIONS</h3>
                    <p>The lions (Panthera leo) are a large cats of the genus Panthera, native to Sub-Saharan Africa and India. 
                They have  muscular, broad-chested bodies; short, rounded heads; round ears; and a dark, 
                hairy tuft at the tip of their tails. They are sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females 
                and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. 
                A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions 
                usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. 
                The lions are an apex and keystone predators.</p>
                    <p>In zoos, lions have been bred with tigers to create hybrids for the curiosity of visitors 
                or for scientific purpose. The liger is bigger than a lion and a tiger, whereas most 
                tigons are relatively small compared to their parents because of reciprocal gene effects. 
                The leopon is a hybrid between a lion and leopard.</p>
                    <p>African lions live in scattered populations across sub-Saharan Africa. The lion prefers 
                grassy plains and savannahs, scrub bordering rivers, and open woodlands with bushes. 
                It rarely enters closed forests. On Mount Elgon, the lion has been recorded up to an 
                elevation of 3,600 m (11,800 ft) and close to the snow line on Mount Kenya. 
                Savannahs with an annual rainfall of 300 to 1,500 mm (12 to 59 in) make up the 
                majority of lion habitat in Africa, estimated at 3,390,821 km2 (1,309,203 sq mi) at most, 
                but remnant populations are also present in tropical moist forests in West Africa 
                and montane forests in East Africa. The Asiatic lion now survives only in and around 
                Gir National Park in Gujarat, western India. Its habitat is a mixture of dry savannah 
                forest and very dry, deciduous scrub forest.</p>

                        <p>You will find the lions at pen E21, right next to the elephants</p>
