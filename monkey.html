                    <h3>Monkey</h3>
                    <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, 
                also known as simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are 
                counted as monkeys except the apes. Thus monkeys, in that sense, constitute an incomplete 
                paraphyletic grouping; alternatively, if apes (Hominoidea) are included, monkeys and 
                simians are synonyms. Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there 
                are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are mainly 
                active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, 
                especially the Old World monkeys.</p>
                    <p>As apes have emerged in the monkey group as sister of the old world monkeys, 
                characteristics that describe monkeys are generally shared by apes as well. Williams et al. 
                outlined evolutionary features, including in stem groupings, contrasted against the other 
                primates such as the tarsiers and the lemuriformes. Monkeys range in size from the 
                pygmy marmoset, which can be as small as 117 mm (4+5⁄8 in) with a 172 mm (6+3⁄4 in) 
                tail and just over 100 g (3+1⁄2 oz) in weight, to the male mandrill, 
                almost 1 m (3 ft 3 in) long and weighing up to 36 kg (79 lb). 
                Some are arboreal (living in trees) while others live on the savanna; diets differ 
                among the various species but may contain any of the following: fruit, leaves, seeds, 
                nuts, flowers, eggs and small animals (including insects and spiders).</p>
                    <p>The many species of monkey have varied relationships with humans. 
                Some are kept as pets, others used as model organisms in laboratories or in space missions. 
                They may be killed in monkey drives (when they threaten agriculture) or used as service animals 
                for the disabled.</p>
