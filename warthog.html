                    <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
                    <p>The common warthog is a medium-sized species, with a head-and-body length ranging from 0.9 to 1.5 m 
                (2 ft 11 in to 4 ft 11 in), and shoulder height from 63.5 to 85 cm (25.0 to 33.5 in). Females, 
                at 45 to 75 kg (99 to 165 lb), are smaller and lighter than males, at 60 to 150 kg (130 to 330 lb). 
                A warthog is identifiable by the two pairs of tusks protruding from the mouth and curving upwards. 
                The lower pair, which is far shorter than the upper pair, becomes razor-sharp by rubbing against the upper 
                pair every time the mouth is opened and closed. The upper canine teeth can grow to 25.5 cm (10.0 in) long 
                and have a wide elliptical cross section, being about 4.5 cm (1.8 in) deep and 2.5 cm (0.98 in) wide. A tusk will 
                curve 90Â° or more from the root, and will not lie flat on a table, as it curves somewhat backwards as it grows. 
                The tusks are not used for digging, but are used for combat with other hogs and in defense against predators the lower set can inflict severe wounds.</p>
                    <p>The head of the common warthog is large, with a mane down the spine to the middle of the back. 
                Sparse hair covers the body. Its color is usually black or brown. Tails are long and end with a tuft of hair. 
                Common warthogs do not have subcutaneous fat and the coat is sparse, making them susceptible to 
                extreme environmental temperatures.</p>
                    <p>The common warthog is the only pig species that has adapted to grazing and savanna habitats. 
                Its diet is omnivorous, composed of grasses, roots, berries and other fruits, bark, fungi, insects, 
                eggs and carrion. The diet is seasonably variable, depending on availability of different food items. 
                During the wet seasons, warthogs graze on short perennial grasses. During the dry seasons, 
                they subsist on bulbs, rhizomes, and nutritious roots.</p>
                        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                        <p>You will find the warthogs at pen E21, right next to the kangaroos</p>
